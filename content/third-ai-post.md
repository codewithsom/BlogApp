Welcome, AI enthusiasts! Today‚Äôs blog post delves into some of the most recent and intriguing developments in the world of artificial intelligence and technology. From major AI companies allegedly using YouTube videos without permission to YouTube Music's latest AI-generated radio feature, there's plenty to explore. We'll also touch on new AI tools, significant tech news, and even provide a quick tutorial on creating stunning presentations with Gamma AI. Let's dive in!

## AI Giants Steal Training Data

### The Revelation

A recent investigation by Proof News has uncovered a significant ethical dilemma in the tech industry. Major AI companies, including Anthropic, Nvidia, Apple, and Salesforce, have been accused of using subtitles from over 173,536 YouTube videos across 48,000 channels to train their AI models without obtaining permission from content creators. The content in question includes educational material from renowned sources like Khan Academy, MIT, and Harvard, as well as popular shows such as ‚ÄúThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert.‚Äù

### The Impact

Many content creators, including well-known YouTubers like MrBeast and PewDiePie, were unaware that their content was being utilized in this manner. This has raised significant issues regarding consent and compensation. The use of YouTube video data by AI companies underscores the need for clearer regulations and more transparent practices, balancing technological advancement with the rights of creators.

## YouTube Music Tests AI-Generated Radio

### New Features

YouTube Music is enhancing its platform with two innovative features aimed at improving song discovery. These include an AI-generated conversational radio and a new tool for identifying songs by sound.
